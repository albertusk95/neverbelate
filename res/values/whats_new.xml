    <string name="whats_new_message">Version 1.0_build-13:\n\nAdded a new Early Arrival parameter to the Settings
        menu. Set it for how early you wish to arrive at your destination, and NeverBeLate™ will account
        for that extra time when determining what time to alert you for your next event. The default Early Arrival
        value is five minutes.\n
        \nVersion 1.0_build-12:\n\nAdded the ability to mark events for NeverBeLate™
        to find by placing an asterisk or star (*) at the beginning of the event location. For example,
        \"*221b Baker Street, London, UK\" or \"*Houston, TX\". Now if a coworker invites you to a meeting 
        with a location of \"Conference Room 4b\", NeverBeLate™ will just ignore that event and will not 
        warn you incorrectly. To enable Marked Locations, simply check the box labeled \"Only marked locations\"
        in the Settings menu. Then start placing an asterisk or star (*) at the beginning of your searchable event locations.</string>
