    <string name="whats_new_message">Good news! I have added the ability to mark events for NeverBeLate™
        to find by placing an asterisk or star (*) at the beginning of the event location. For example,
        \"*221b Baker Street, London, UK\" or \"*Houston, TX\". Now if a coworker invites you to a meeting 
        with a location of \"Conference Room 4b\", NeverBeLate™ will just ignore that event and will not 
        warn you incorrectly.\n
        \nEnabling \"marked locations\" is simple: just press \"Configure Settings\" on the main screen of 
        NeverBeLate™, and check the box labeled \"Only marked locations\". Then start placing an asterisk
        or star (*) at the beginning of your searchable event locations.\n
        \nIf you LOVE NeverBeLate™, don\'t forget to share it with your friends and coworkers using the 
        \"Share with a friend\" button! And if you have any problems or questions about this new feature, then let me know with the \"Send feedback\" button in the Settings menu. Thanks!</string>
