## Open Sourced for your learning pleasure

Decided to open source it today for a few reasons:

1. **I'm no longer going to maintain it.** Feel free to pick it up and run with new features and ideas if you like.
2. I've never made much money from it: a **whopping $21** in the past 1.5 years, I think.
3. **Google Now** has replaced most of the functionality in this app on Android 4.1+ devices, and consequently **I** don't even use the app anymore.
4. Because I like sharing! :-)

## What would I do differently next time?

This was probably my first large and important piece of code, and I naturally did lots of **Bad Things** during its development.  Now that I'm wiser and more mature in my **coding kung fu skills**, I'd do some things a bit different:

1. **WRITE SPECS.**  That one deserves capital screaming letters.  I tested everything manually on a physical Android phone back then, which took _fooorrreeevvveeerrrr_.  TDD is my new middle name these days.
2. **Refactor along the way.**  Back then I didn't know how awesome and expressive code could be if you refactored it correctly along the way, so lots of my methods were a bajillion lines long and were very difficult to read, even for me - the guy who wrote them.  Writing small, descriptive methods is the way to go.
3. **Uses spaces instead of tabs.**  You wouldn't think it's that important, but it really is.
4. **WRITE SPECS.**  In case you missed the first one.

I'm sure there are more, but that's a good list.

## Whoa man, you checked-in your AdMob token!

Sure did.  A long time ago, before I knew better. Not a lot of danger there, though, since if you run ads with that token, **I'll get the money instead of you**.  So be sure to change it on yours!

## Contributing

The customary process, of course:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
